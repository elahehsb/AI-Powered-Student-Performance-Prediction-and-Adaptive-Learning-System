# AI-Powered Student Performance Prediction and Adaptive Learning System


### Overview
This project aims to develop an AI-powered system for predicting student performance and providing adaptive learning recommendations. The system will use machine learning algorithms to analyze student data and offer personalized content and feedback to enhance the learning experience. The project focuses on using open-source tools and a Linux-based environment to build a scalable and efficient solution.

### Project Goals
##### Data Collection and Storage: Gather and store student interaction data.
##### Data Processing and Analysis: Process and analyze the collected data to extract meaningful insights.
##### Machine Learning: Develop models to predict student performance and recommend personalized learning paths.
##### User Interface: Create an interactive web-based UI for students and educators.
##### Deployment: Use containerization and orchestration for deployment.

### System Architecture
##### Data Collection: Collect data from various sources such as LMS (Learning Management Systems), quizzes, and assignments.
##### Data Storage: Store the data in a NoSQL database like MongoDB for flexibility.
##### Data Processing: Use Apache Kafka for data streaming and Apache Spark for processing.
##### Machine Learning: Train models using libraries like Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow.
##### User Interface: Develop the UI using React.js and Flask.
##### Deployment: Use Docker and Kubernetes for deployment.
